    <p>Fettuccine[a] is a type of pasta popular in Roman cuisine. It is descended from the extremely thin capelli d'angelo of the Renaissance,[2] but is a flat, thick pasta traditionally made with egg and flour (usually one egg for every 100 grams or 3.5 ounces of flour). At about 6.5 mm (1‚ÅÑ4 inch), it is wider and thicker than, but similar to, the tagliatelle typical of Bologna,[3][4] which are more common elsewhere in Italy and is often used as a synonym.
